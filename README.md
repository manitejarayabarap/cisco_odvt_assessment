# Device Measurement Challenge

## Setup

> **IMPORTANT — Read before you start**
>
> **Fork this repo to your own public GitHub account.**
> Work in your fork. **DO NOT open a pull request back to this repository.**
> Doing so would expose your work to other candidates.
> **Failure to follow this instruction will be penalized.**

1. Fork this repo to your own public GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script to confirm everything works:
   ```bash
   python collect_data.py
   ```

## Background

`collect_data.py` sweeps a device under test through a grid of parameter
settings, collects signal characterisation measurements for each, and saves
results to a CSV file.

The device is simulated — no real equipment needed. `device_sim.py` handles
communication with the simulation server. In practice, a sweep like this runs
unattended for several minutes while a test engineer waits for results.

**Goal:** Find the combination of parameters that maximises `snr_db`.
The other measurements (`eye_height_mv`, `eye_width_ps`, `ber`) are correlated
with SNR and can support your analysis.

**Parameters you can set on the device:**

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tx_level` | 0–255 | Transmit amplitude DAC level |
| `eq_gain` | 0–15 | Receiver equalizer gain |
| `pre_emphasis` | 0–7 | Transmitter pre-emphasis tap weight |

**Measurements returned:**

| Measurement | Description |
|---|---|
| `snr_db` | Signal-to-noise ratio in dB |
| `eye_height_mv` | Eye opening height in millivolts |
| `eye_width_ps` | Eye opening width in picoseconds |
| `ber` | Estimated bit error rate |

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `device_sim.py` | **Do not modify.** Hardware driver. |
| `collect_data.py` | Data collection script — modify this. |
| `analyze_results.py` | Write this from scratch. |

---

## Task 1 — Make `collect_data.py` smarter

The script works but it sweeps all combinations blindly regardless of outcome.
Make it smarter. What smarter means is up to you.

## Task 2 — Write `analyze_results.py`

Write a script that loads `results.csv` and visualizes the results. Think about
what would actually help someone decide where to look next.

## Submission

Once done, push your work to your fork and send Onyeka the link to your repo.

Please include a brief write-up — either in a `NOTES.md` file or in your final
commit message — answering the following:

1. What did you change in `collect_data.py` and why?
2. What does your visualization show? What does it suggest about the device?
3. What would you do next if you had more time?
4. If this were a real device on a real bench, what would you do differently?

**If you used AI assistance**, include the transcript or a summary of how you
used it as part of your submission.

> Try not to spend more than 1–2 hours total.
